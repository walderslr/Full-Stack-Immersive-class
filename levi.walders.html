        <h1>Childhood</h1>
        <p style="color:rgb(71, 34, 139);> ="This is a paragraph."> <i>I had a rather large family growing up, I was the youngest of 6 children. I had three brothers and
            two sisters. My oldest brother is almost 14 years older then I am. My parents had there first child when my mom was 16.
            I grew up in rural Iowa, I know it sounds terrible but it's a life that I definitely miss. The feeling of complete safety because
            you know everyone and everyone either knows you or knows one of your relatives. When people say everyone waves and says hello,
            well, that's true, even know when I go home to visit everyone still remembers who you are. One of the best experiences I had as
            growing up was fishing, we used to spend hours fishing on the lake.Depending on the day and time of year we could catch
            50-100 bull heads at a time. <img src="Ameiurus_nebulosus.jpg" alt="Brown_Bullhead"> </i>
        </p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>As I have gotten older my hobbes have changed imensely, I now enjoy playing basketball, video games, reading and most
            importantly spending time with my kiddos. Even though I have gotten older I have always had a love of video games, it all started with
            the <b>Mario/Duck Hunt</b> comob back in the day. We used to sit around the TV for hours taking turns and competing to see how was
            the better shot or who could get Mario the furthest in all of the castles. </p>
        <h3>Starting a family</h3>
        <p>The best part of me is that I now have a family of my own. I met my wife when I was in high school, we dated for a while but decided
            to go our own ways for a while. Fortunately, for me, she decided that I was worth talking to again. We have now been happily married
            for almost 9 years and have 3 wonder boys of our own. I say wonder but what I really mean is chaotic, messy and lovable boys.

        <h4>Joining the Military</h4>
            <img src="hh-60g-pave-hawk_006.jpg" alt="Helo">
        <p>Before we decided two have our children we made a big commitment, a commitment that would change our lives forever.
            I decided that I wanted to get us out of the small towns we were stuck in and do something bigger with myself. 
            The options were multiple but the best fit for me was <sup>The United States Air Force.</sup> I joined the Air Force in 2011 and
            due to some unfortunate circumstances I was medically retired. Even though I was medically retired I get to work as a 
            civlian contractor doing the exact same thing, which is, scheduling. I schedule Exercise, air space requirements as well <br>
            as many othter things. 
        </p>
        <h5>Having my first child</h5>
        <p><sub>One of the best moments of my life was having my first child. The excitement, the nerves and all of the emotions one 
            feel leading up to the days that we finally got to meet our little guy was awesome. <b>My wife has some issues with her
            blood pressure and unknown to us, we were going to meet our little dude way before we had planned to have everything ready.</b>
            I remember the day she went into the hospital cause she wasn't feeling well like it was yesterday, she went from calling me to
            say she was getting a ride to the ER cause she had the flu to her telling me she was getting an ambulance ride to a down town
            Las Vegas hospital cause the base hospital didn't do emergency C-sections before 37 weeks. We had to get a rush flight for her 
            mom but thankfully everything worked out, her mom got there in time and her and the baby were both healthy after the C-section.</sub>
